How to create a Thread

Using Runnable (implements Runnable)
Using Thread Class

Interface Runnable{
    run();
}

class Thread{  (extends Runnable)
    
}


class MyThread implements Runnable{ - you need to create only this implement Runnable
  Run(){
  }
}

class MyThread1 extends Thread{
  Run(){
  }
}

Starting Thread
MyThread myThread = new MyThread();
Thread thread = new Thread(myThread);
thread.start();


MyThread1 t1 = new MyThread();
t1.start();

in runnable there is not method start to start the thread so if you creating using Thread class then you can directly call start since it has start method
